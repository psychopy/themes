The base themes for Psychopy come in both light and dark versions, with three flavours of each:
## Psychopy
The default post-2020 look for Psychopy, this theme uses modern icons and the Psychopy colour scheme, based on the following colours:

## Minimal
Similar to the Psychopy theme, but with fewer colours. This sacrifices the information given by the default theme's colours for a less busy look.
## Classic
This theme is designed to look like pre-2020 Psychopy, using the "classic" icon set and, in the light theme, the same colours in Coder view as before the 2020 update.
